# Portfolio
I develop the Portfolio Using Html CSS and JavaScript  As an aspiring IT professional, I designed and developed a Personal
Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a
responsive design, dynamic elements, project showcases, and a contact form. It
allowed me to exhibit my technical skills, projects, and achievements, serving as a
valuable asset during my job search. Proudly included in my resume, this project
reflects my dedication and passion for technology and innovation.
